# üöÄ Network Automation Platform - User Guide

## üéØ **Getting Started**

### **What is the Network Automation Platform?**

The Network Automation Platform is an AI-powered Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides intelligent network management capabilities through conversation with Claude AI. It enables network engineers to:

- Monitor network health and performance
- Troubleshoot issues with AI assistance
- Generate and deploy configurations automatically
- Perform proactive network optimization
- Track changes and maintain audit trails

### **Prerequisites**

- **Claude AI Access**: Available through Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, or API
- **Network Access**: Connection to target network devices
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.8+ with required dependencies
- **Permissions**: Appropriate network device credentials

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation & Setup**

### **1. Environment Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd network-automation/CLOUD_AVAILABILITY_ZONE

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp config/auth_config.yaml.example config/auth_config.yaml
cp config/api_keys.yaml.example config/api_keys.yaml
```

### **2. Configuration**

#### **Device Configuration** (`devices.yaml`)
```yaml
devices:
  SPINE1:
    ip: 192.168.1.10
    type: spine
    os: nxos
    credentials:
      username: admin
      password: ${DEVICE_PASSWORD}
  LEAF1:
    ip: 192.168.1.20
    type: leaf
    os: ios
    credentials:
      username: admin
      password: ${DEVICE_PASSWORD}
```

#### **Network Topology** (`network_topology.yaml`)
```yaml
topology:
  type: spine-leaf
  spine_devices: [SPINE1, SPINE2]
  leaf_devices: [LEAF1, LEAF2, LEAF3]
  connections:
    - from: SPINE1
      to: LEAF1
      interface_from: Eth1/1
      interface_to: GigabitEthernet0/1
```

### **3. Start the MCP Server**

```bash
# Start the enhanced MCP server
python3 mcp/enhanced_mcp_server.py
```

### **4. Connect to Claude**

Add the MCP server to your Claude configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "network-automation": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp/enhanced_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üí¨ **Using Claude for Network Automation**

### **Basic Network Monitoring**

**Example Conversation:**

üë§ **You**: "What's the current status of my network?"

ü§ñ **Claude**: "I'll check your network status now."

*[Claude calls `get_network_status` tool]*

ü§ñ **Claude**: "Your network shows:
- **Overall Status**: Healthy
- **Total Devices**: 6 (5 active, 1 down)
- **Topology**: Spine-leaf architecture
- **Issue**: LEAF3 appears to be unreachable

Would you like me to investigate the LEAF3 issue further?"

üë§ **You**: "Yes, please check what's wrong with LEAF3"

ü§ñ **Claude**: "Let me analyze the LEAF3 issue."

*[Claude calls `get_device_details` and `analyze_network_issue` tools]*

ü§ñ **Claude**: "Analysis of LEAF3:
- **Status**: Unreachable
- **Last Seen**: 2 hours ago
- **Likely Cause**: Interface Eth1/1 is down
- **Recommendation**: Check physical connectivity and interface configuration

Would you like me to generate a configuration to bring the interface back up?"

### **Configuration Management**

**Example Conversation:**

üë§ **You**: "I need to configure VLAN 100 on LEAF1 interface Ethernet0/1"

ü§ñ **Claude**: "I'll generate the VLAN configuration for LEAF1."

*[Claude calls `generate_configuration` tool]*

ü§ñ **Claude**: "Generated configuration for LEAF1:
```
interface Ethernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 100
 no shutdown
```

This configuration will:
- Set the interface to access mode
- Assign it to VLAN 100
- Ensure the interface is enabled

Would you like me to deploy this configuration?"

üë§ **You**: "Yes, but schedule it for maintenance window tonight at 2 AM"

ü§ñ **Claude**: "I'll schedule the configuration deployment."

*[Claude calls `deploy_configuration` tool with scheduled deployment]*

ü§ñ **Claude**: "Configuration deployment scheduled:
- **Deployment ID**: dep_12345
- **Device**: LEAF1
- **Scheduled Time**: 2025-08-06 02:00:00 UTC
- **Status**: Pending approval

The deployment is now in the approval queue. You can approve it when ready."

### **Troubleshooting with AI**

**Example Conversation:**

üë§ **You**: "Users are complaining about slow network performance between Building A and Building B"

ü§ñ **Claude**: "I'll analyze the performance issue between your buildings."

*[Claude calls multiple tools: `get_network_trends`, `analyze_network_correlation`, `get_performance_optimizations`]*

ü§ñ **Claude**: "Performance Analysis Results:

**Identified Issues:**
1. High utilization (85%) on SPINE1-LEAF2 link
2. Suboptimal BGP routing causing traffic hairpinning
3. Interface buffer overruns on SPINE1 Eth1/2

**Root Cause**: Traffic from Building A to Building B is routing through an inefficient path due to BGP route preference.

**Recommended Solutions:**
1. Adjust BGP local preference on LEAF2
2. Enable ECMP load balancing on spine switches
3. Increase buffer sizes on high-utilization interfaces

**Estimated Impact**: 40-60% improvement in inter-building latency

Would you like me to generate the configurations to implement these optimizations?"

### **Proactive Monitoring**

**Example Conversation:**

üë§ **You**: "Start monitoring my network for any performance issues"

ü§ñ **Claude**: "I'll set up comprehensive network monitoring."

*[Claude calls `start_network_monitoring` and `start_proactive_monitoring`]*

ü§ñ **Claude**: "Proactive monitoring is now active:

**Monitoring Scope:**
- Performance metrics (every 60 seconds)
- Device health checks (every 5 minutes)
- Security events (real-time)
- Capacity utilization trends

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Interface utilization > 80%
- Device CPU > 75%
- Memory usage > 85%
- Packet loss > 0.1%

I'll proactively alert you to any issues and provide AI-powered recommendations for resolution. You can ask me anytime for the current monitoring status or recent alerts."
