# Proactive Network Monitoring and Alerting

## Overview

The proactive monitoring system provides continuous network monitoring with intelligent alerting, threshold-based and anomaly-based alert generation, and automated escalation logic. This system is designed to proactively detect and respond to network issues before they impact operations.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Capabilities
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of network devices and protocols
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Multi-level alert system with prioritization
- **Automated Escalation**: Configurable escalation paths with notification management
- **Alert Correlation**: Groups related alerts to reduce noise
- **Threshold Management**: Static and dynamic threshold monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI-powered anomaly detection based on historical baselines

### ðŸ“Š Alert Priority Levels
- **EMERGENCY**: Immediate action required (1 minute escalation)
- **CRITICAL**: Urgent attention needed (5 minutes escalation)
- **HIGH**: Important issues (15 minutes escalation)
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate concerns (30 minutes escalation)
- **LOW**: Informational (1 hour escalation)

### ðŸ”” Notification Types
- **Email**: SMTP-based email notifications
- **Webhook**: HTTP POST notifications to external systems
- **Slack**: Slack channel notifications (configurable)
- **Teams**: Microsoft Teams notifications (configurable)

## Quick Start

### 1. Configuration

Edit the monitoring configuration file:
```yaml
# /opt/network-automation/CLOUD_AVAILABILITY_ZONE/config/monitoring_config.yaml
monitoring_interval: 60  # seconds
escalation_check_interval: 300  # seconds

notification_settings:
  email:
    enabled: true
    smtp_server: "smtp.company.com"
    smtp_port: 587
    username: "monitoring@company.com"
    password: "your-password"
    from_address: "network-monitoring@company.com"
    default_recipients:
      - "admin@company.com"
      - "netops@company.com"
```

### 2. Start Monitoring

#### Via MCP Tools (Recommended)
```python
# Through Claude/MCP interface
result = start_proactive_monitoring()
```

#### Via Command Line
```bash
cd /opt/network-automation/CLOUD_AVAILABILITY_ZONE
python3 services/proactive_monitoring.py --start
```

### 3. Monitor Active Alerts

#### Via MCP Tools
```python
# Get all active alerts
alerts = get_active_alerts()

# Get critical alerts only
critical_alerts = get_active_alerts(priority_filter="CRITICAL")

# Get alerts for specific device
device_alerts = get_active_alerts(device_filter="SPINE1")
```

#### Via Command Line
```bash
python3 services/proactive_monitoring.py --alerts
```

## MCP Tool Integration

The proactive monitoring system is fully integrated with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, providing the following tools for Claude:

### Available MCP Tools

2. **stop_proactive_monitoring()**
   - Stops the proactive monitoring service
   - Returns: Operation status

3. **get_active_alerts(priority_filter=None, device_filter=None)**
   - Retrieves current active alerts with optional filtering
   - Parameters:
     - `priority_filter`: Filter by priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY)
     - `device_filter`: Filter by device name (partial match)
   - Returns: List of active alerts with statistics

4. **acknowledge_alert(alert_id, acknowledged_by)**
   - Acknowledges an alert to stop escalation
   - Parameters:
     - `alert_id`: ID of the alert to acknowledge
     - `acknowledged_by`: Username of person acknowledging
   - Returns: Acknowledgment status

5. **get_proactive_monitoring_status()**

### Example Usage with Claude

```markdown
"Start proactive monitoring for the network"
â†’ Claude uses start_proactive_monitoring()

"Show me all critical alerts"
â†’ Claude uses get_active_alerts(priority_filter="CRITICAL")

"Acknowledge alert alert_001 as admin"
â†’ Claude uses acknowledge_alert("alert_001", "admin")

"What's the status of network monitoring?"
â†’ Claude uses get_proactive_monitoring_status()
```

## Alert Rules Configuration

### Built-in Alert Rules

#### CPU Monitoring
- **cpu_warning**: CPU > 75% for 5 minutes (MEDIUM priority)
- **cpu_high**: CPU > 85% for 3 minutes (HIGH priority)  
- **cpu_critical**: CPU > 95% for 1 minute (CRITICAL priority)

#### Memory Monitoring
- **memory_warning**: Memory > 80% for 5 minutes (MEDIUM priority)
- **memory_high**: Memory > 90% for 3 minutes (HIGH priority)
- **memory_critical**: Memory > 98% for 1 minute (CRITICAL priority)

#### Connectivity Monitoring
- **device_unreachable**: Device not responding for 2 minutes (CRITICAL priority)

#### Interface Monitoring
- **interface_down**: Critical interface down for 1 minute (HIGH priority)

#### Protocol Monitoring
- **bgp_neighbor_down**: BGP neighbor down for 2 minutes (HIGH priority)
- **ospf_neighbor_down**: OSPF neighbor down for 2 minutes (HIGH priority)

### Custom Alert Rules

Add custom rules in the configuration file:

```yaml
alert_rules:
  custom_cpu_rule:
    enabled: true
    metric_type: "cpu"
    threshold_value: 90.0
    comparison: "gt"
    duration: 120  # 2 minutes
    priority: "HIGH"
    suppress_duration: 300  # 5 minutes
    device_filter: "SPINE.*"  # Only apply to SPINE devices
```

## Escalation Configuration

### Default Escalation Rules

#### CRITICAL Priority
1. **Level 1** (5 minutes): Email to admin + webhook
2. **Level 2** (15 minutes): Email to manager + on-call
3. **Level 3** (30 minutes): Email to director

#### HIGH Priority
1. **Level 1** (15 minutes): Email to admin
2. **Level 2** (30 minutes): Email to manager

### Custom Escalation Rules

```yaml
escalation_rules:
  EMERGENCY:
    escalation_delay: 60  # 1 minute
    max_escalations: 4
    escalation_levels:
      - level: 1
        delay: 60
        notifications:
          - type: "email"
            targets: ["admin@company.com"]
          - type: "webhook"
            targets: ["http://oncall.company.com/webhook"]
```

## Alert Correlation

The system automatically correlates related alerts to reduce noise:

### Correlation Types
- **Time-based**: Groups alerts occurring within 5 minutes
- **Device-based**: Groups multiple alerts from the same device
- **Causality-based**: Groups alerts with known relationships

### Correlation Example
```
Device SPINE1 experiences:
- High CPU alert
- High memory alert  
- Interface flapping

These get correlated into a single alert group with correlation ID.
```

## Maintenance Windows

Configure maintenance windows to suppress alerts during planned maintenance:

```yaml
maintenance_windows:
  - name: "Weekly Maintenance"
    enabled: true
    day_of_week: 0  # Sunday
    start_time: "02:00"
    end_time: "04:00"
    timezone: "UTC"
```

## Advanced Features

### Anomaly Detection

The system learns normal behavior patterns and detects anomalies:

```yaml
anomaly_detection:
  enabled: true
  threshold_multiplier: 2.0  # Standard deviations from baseline
  minimum_samples: 20
  learning_period: 7  # Days
```

### Device-Specific Overrides

Configure different thresholds for specific devices:

```yaml
device_overrides:
  SPINE1:
    cpu_critical: 90.0  # Higher threshold for core device
    memory_critical: 95.0
```

### Performance Settings

Tune performance for large environments:

```yaml
performance:
  max_concurrent_checks: 10
  check_timeout: 30
  cache_ttl: 300
  batch_size: 50
```

- API keys required for external access
- Session management for web interfaces
- Audit logging for all operations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data filtering in responses
- Encrypted storage for credentials
- Secure communication channels
- Privacy controls for personal data

### Network Security
- Monitoring traffic uses secure protocols
- API endpoints are authenticated
- Webhook payloads are signed
- Network access is restricted

## Future Enhancements
